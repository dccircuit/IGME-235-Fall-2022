# The end of Dig Dug.

Chances are, your final Dig Dug page is full of random attempts at getting things to cooperate.  Some successful, and some not, but either way, it's a collection of your efforts so far this semester.  We want to see what you've accomplished (or at least tried) overall.  

## This will be the final submission of your work.

1.	Upload it to the same directory in your banjo account that you've been using over the last two weeks. 
2.	You should zip up your complete game directory that you've been working on locally (complete with images, css, second html page, favicons, etc).
3.	Go to myCourses and submit the zip file to the Assignment titled “HTML Lab Work (End of Dig Dug)”
4.	In the Comments field, supply the URL to the page live in your banjo account (make sure it's clickable).

After it's submitted, continue on to the next lab exercises!
