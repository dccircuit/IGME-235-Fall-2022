# Exercise: Good Web Practices Hunt 

This can be a team exercise.  **If you are present for the in-person Lab**, your instructor will divide you into four teams using some highly technical (or not) method.  You can move closer together or each stay at your own computer.  The instructor will assign you one of the 4 categories below.  Follow the instructions for that category.  Try to search quickly, we'll share findings in about 10 minutes. **If you are remote,** instead, randomly pick one of the four categories below (or pick one that appeals to you) and look for an example site on your own.

## Do the following:
### If you are in a "Progressive Enhancement" team:
- Search the web for a site that exhibits Progressive Enhancement.
- One or two people should be looking at sites with JavaScript disabled, and others should look at the same sites with Javascript enabled.
- Find a site that is still usable and provides baseline functionality with JavaScript off, but improves the experience with JavaScript on.
- When you, as a team, find a site that you agree you want to present, make sure that you have it loaded up (in two browsers on the same computer one with JS off, one with JS on) and let the instructor know you're ready.

### If you are in a "Responsive Design" team:
- Search the web for a site that exhibits Response Design.
- You should be able to test for responsive design simply by dragging your browser windows narrower and wider.
- Find a site that is shows the content being resized for good reasons... Not just a page that changes, but that re-organizes its content to make the mobile experience better.  Perhaps one that changes that way buttons or menus are display when you go mobile to make them easier to use.  Or a website that displays features that are more useful to mobile users than to desktop users.
- When you, as a team, find a site that you agree you want to present, make sure that you have it loaded up in a browser and then let the instructor know that you're ready.

### If you are in a "Good Accessibility" team:
- Search the web for a site that exhibits Good Accessibility.
- Accessibility features make it easier for individuals with visual, mobility, auditory, and/or cognitive impairments to use a site.
- Find a site that has features that make it's usage easier for one or more of these groups.  Ideally two or more.  
- When you, as a team, find a site that you agree you want to present, make sure that you have it loaded up in a browser and then let the instructor know that you're ready.

### If you are in a "Excellent Performance" team:
- Search the web for a site that exhibits Excellent Performance (at least compared with another similar site)
- Look for a pair of sites with similar functionality where one site clearly performs better than the other.
- See if you can determine reasons for why there is this performance discrepancy between the sites.
- When you, as a team, find a pair of sites that you agree you want to present, make sure that you have them both loaded up in two side-by-side windows (on a single screen) and then let the instructor know you're ready.

## In the in-person lab, after about 10 minutes, all team representatives should alert the instructor that they are ready to share their findings to the whole class.

## If you are remote:  You can choose to do it the easier way or the harder, but cooler, way:
1. Easier: Post the URL to the site(s) that you found above to the "#exercise-sites" Slack channel and describe what "Good Practice" they exemplify.  What does this site (the good one) do particuarly well or better than other site(s)?
2. Harder: Present your site using a Screen Recorder.  This is something you'll need to be able to do toward the end of the semester, so it may be worth practicing now, but I realize you're probably busy.  I also don't have time to explain it much except to point you to this (one of many!) video tutorials about how to record your screen with Open Broadcaster Software: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsNsd5QdOhE (this one is pretty short and to the point for just doing a simple screen recording)  After recording, upload to YouTube, set to Unlisted (not Private), and share the URL in the "#exercise-sites" Slack channel.

## After presentations are over:
- **In-Person Teams**: Have someone on the team post the URL to the "#exercise-sites" Slack channel with a short explanation so that those who couldn't be here can see what you found.
- **All**: If you found another, or your own good example in one of these categories, add it to the same Slack channel with an explanation for why you picked it.  You can do this at any point later in the semester as well.  The channel will stay open.
