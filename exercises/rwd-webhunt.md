# Exercise: Responsive Web Design Webhunt

Your mission:  Locate a (unique*) website that showcases many aspects of Responsive Web Design.  Count the features and document it on the shared Slack channel.

*by unique, we mean that it hasn't been picked by anyone else so far.  (The earlier you do this exercise, the easier that will be).

## Do the following:

Search on the web for a website that features responsive mobile web design.  

Some ideas of the kinds of sites to look for:
- Clothing brands
- Restaurant chains
- Banking websites
- News outlets

Get those browsers out of "maximized" mode and start adjusting browser widths!

In particular look for these 5 features (discussed in Chapter 17 in your book):
- A **fluid** layout
- Multiple **breakpoints**
- A **layout** where sections drop or shift to new locations when narrower.
- **Typography** that becomes more legible, smaller, with tighter line heights, and/or with narrower margins on narrow screens.
- A **navigation** style that changes at a narrow breakpoint.

The more of these features you find, the better.  When you have your site, create a post in the "#exercise-rwd" channel in this format:   #/5 (list, of, bold, keywords, from, above) URL_to_site / Any additional notes you want to add about what you found.

Example:   4/5 (fluid, breakpoints, layout, navigation) http://www.rit.edu / RIT's Mobile site is VERY different from it's desktop site in terms of layout & navigation.  All content is still represented with a couple elements removed.  I didn't notice much typography change throughout the page, although the font size in the mobile menus is larger than it is in the desktop site.

- This counts toward your participation grade in the course, so be sure to post by the time the other lab exercise is due.
- If two people accidentally pick the same site and make different posts about it, I'm not going to fret about it... But don't just go to the channel and pick the same one as someone else... *try* to find something that someone else didn't already pick.  Maybe be inspired by the kinds of sites that people are finding and look for something similar... or size up a competitor's site?
- Also, feel free to comment on (use threads) and/or use reaction emoji's on other people's submissions.
