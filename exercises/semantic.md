# Exercise: Structural and Semantic HTML 

The is the last lab exercise for this week.  Finish strong!  Don't forget to ask for help if needed.  Don't spend a lot of time (especially in the in-person lab) being stuck.

## Do as much of the following as possible:

1. Continue with your previous (freshly valid!) in-class exercise.

    - Add `<hr>` between sections

    - Add appropriate additional `<h2>`, `<h3>` (you might not need any h3s)

    - Turn the Publishing Information and Game Genre Information into two separate Unordered Lists

    - If you didn't already, add a blockquote for the review excerpt.

1. Confirm that all of the above have worked (they all have a visible effect).

1. Add organizing/semantic tags:

    - Add a `<main>` section. What section is "main"... (hint: most if not all of it)
    - Add a `<header>` section. What info is in your header?
    - Add a `<footer>` with information about where the content is from.

1. Add inline elements for additional formatting (your choice as to where they might be appropriate):
    - Italics (for emphasis), 
    - Bold (for strong meaning), 
    - Mark an acronym so that it's meaning appears on hover.  (Did you know that Namco stands for "Nakamura Manufacturing Company"?)
    - Add more line breaks.

1. Important: Add a `<div>` with an `id` attribute around the "source" info at the very bottom of the page.
    - We won't apply any styling to it just yet, we're just making it so that we can links to it in next week's lab exercises.


## Okay, that's enough for this week. Take the whole game directory so far and put it in your 235 directory on Banjo.
  - Your instructor might ask you to post a link to this to your section-specific channel on Slack! (go check and do so if requested -- in-person sessions will not require this)
  - You'll also be asked to Zip up the folder that you're working in so far and submit it to the first HTML Lab Work assignment.  (include the URL to it on banjo in the comments section).
