# Exercise: Site Design Process

This is a team exercise that will be completed online over the week.  If you're in an in-person lab, you will be randomly assigned into a small team (of about 4 people) with others who are physically in the lab.  If you are online/flex, you'll be put into a private Slack channel, created by your instructor where you can complete the exercise together.

## Here's the Scenario:

Your first job out of college is for an entrepreneur who’s made his fortune with his uncanny knack for buying the right domain names, then hiring a small clever creative team to build a killer web site for it. He has purchased what he believes will be one of the biggest killer domain names of his career and assigned it to you. It’s now up to you to design a site for it. To help you out, he has carefully selected teammates to assist you. (Your professor will inform you of your team). Needless to say, if you do this job well, your career is assured. 

**If you are in an in-person lab**, your Instructor will, next, break you into groups... Probably based on your existing proximity to each other.  You may (as long as you maintain social distancing) work with each other by simply facing each other and talking.  If anyone in the group is uncomfortable with this, you're better off essentially following the instructions below for online/flex students... Ask your Instructor to  make your team a Private Slack Channel right away.

**If you are in an online section or you are currently in flex modality**, your Instructor will (soon) assign you into a group via Slack... You and about 3 others will be added to a Private Slack Channel with your instructor.  It will be named something like *#design-group-secXX-N*.

The domain your boss has purchased will be shared when you are in your teams (or will be shared in your Private Slack Channel).

## What to do as a team:

You'll begin by **Brainstorming**.
	You can do this audibly (in-person or through a mutually agreed upon Zoom/Slack meeting) and/or through a online chat tool.  You could have one person take notes on paper or electronically, or if going a chat route, someone can set up and share a Google Doc, a Trello Board, or just use your private Slack channel -- how you want to work together is your choice.
	
Continue through the following phases of design trying to come up with answers to the given questions... Yes, you'll be making some stuff up!

**In the end**, you should have a package of information and two sketches that can be shared with the rest of the class via Slack in the channel *#exercise-sitedesign*.  You should do so via a single post with answers to the following questions in the body of the post and attachments of your two sketches.  (there will be an example posting pinned to the channel)

You are encouraged to respond to other designs (through comments/emoji), ask questions, and answer those questions by using the "Reply in thread" feature.

## Design Phases

### Phase 1: Define Purpose
1.	Why does this site exist?
    - (You'll need to brainstorm a purpose right away for this exercise)
    - ***Off limits: One topic is off limits, be sure you're aware of this.***
1.	What do you hope to achieve with it?
1.	What's the Goal?
	- Write it out.  We'll ask you for it at the end.
	    - Decide before you move on.

### Phase 2: Consider Audience
1.	Who will be using your site?
    - Who is your target demographic?
1.	What are some characteristics of these users?
1.	What technology will they have?
1.	How might that affect your design?
	- Make some notes.  We'll ask you about this in the end. 

### Phase 3: Gather Ideas & Brainstorm
1. Brainstorm further about what features/sections/content your site could have
	- List numerous ideas without being critical
	- An off-the-wall idea may help bring an excellent 'reasonable' idea to mind
	- Show (or link to) this brainstorming in your Slack Channel so that you instructor can see.
1. List features you came up with
	- Make a list.
1. Examine other sites.
	- what additional ideas did this bring to mind?
1. Ask potential users (if you can find some).
 
### Phase 4: Organize Ideas
1. Take each idea and consider them
    - Do they help the goals of the site defined at the beginning?
    - Seek maximum impact with minimum resource consumption
1. Sort ideas into categories
    - Select the ideas that supported the goal most clearly and group them into categories.
    - Show the results of this grouping/culling (or link to it) in your Slack Channel so that your instructor can see.
 
### Phase 5: Determine Navigation
1. How should this be organized?
	- By category?
	- By date?
	- By alphabetical order?
	- Others?
1. Draw a conceptual diagram.  Note that the website http://diagrams.net could be very useful for both this step and the next Phase, but you are not required to use it. Think boxes with lines between showing connections.  It does not need to be extensive.
 
### Phase 6: Sketch Pages
- Create two pages of rough sketch for your design.  If you were to do it in http://diagrams.net we'd be expecting something no fancier than the kind of drawings you might find in the Wireframes section.  In a normal semester when all students are in-person we'd normally surprise the students with paper and crayons to draw with.  We aren't expecting anything fancier or more time consuming than that.  

- We would like to see a Front Page of your site and an example of one deeper level than that -- an article page, an item page, an entry on your site... whatever makes the most sense as a "main" deeper-than-front-page item on your site.  So, two sketches.

### Phase 7: Present Design to the Class
- You will post your design for all sections of the class to look at any time AFTER Thursday October 1st and before your next in-person Lab.  Online/Flex sections:  Your Instructor will post the expectations for when this should be posted to your Section-Specific channel.
- It should be posted to the *#exercise-sitedesign* channel and should follow the format of the Pinned Post.  Remember that you can enter multiple lines or bullet points in a post by using shift-enter to separate lines.

This exercise will be scored as a group assignment in myCourses.  Nothing needs to be submitted to an Assignment Dropbox... Evidence of all your work should be obvious in your Private Slack Channel and in the posting that someone in your group makes to the exercise channel.
