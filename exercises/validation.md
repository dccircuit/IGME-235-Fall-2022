# Exercise: Validation 

Same as previous exercises:  Figure out how to meet provided goals.  Ask for help if needed.  Let us know if you run into an interesting validation error.

## Do the following:
1. Visit http://validator.nu
2. Validate your "Dig Dug" page by URL, Upload, or Copy/Paste.
3. Correct any errors.

## If you have no errors of your own:
- You could try validating this code:  (the image referred to is [here](mirror.gif), if you want to try to build/display it in a browser) -- Good luck, this code is a mess.  (this is an optional part of the exercise... you can move on to the next exercise whenever you want).
